Connect your Hikvision IP door stations to Home Assistant to receive events (like motion detection or incoming calls) and send back commands (like opening a door connected to the door station relay or rejecting a call).


## Features
- Capture doorbell events: callstatus/motion detection/door unlocked/tamper alarm/dismissed alarm
- Open doors connected to the doorbell (_useful for older devices where port 80 is blocked and `ISAPI` is not available_)
- Remote actions such as answering/rejecting the call, hanging up, etc (via the `ISAPI` API).
_This can be exploited in HA automation. When for example a Zigbee door sensor signals a door opened, the ringing on the indoor stations and on the Hik-Connect devices is stopped. Se the documentation for more details._
- Reboot the door station
